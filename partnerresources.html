        <p>EZShield’s story is at the root of who we are as a service, a company and a brand. Our employees and trusted partners can use this guide to learn more about messaging we encourage and discourage, as well as how to effectively use statistics and other content tools to talk about our services.</p>

          <div class="content"> 
          <h3>
 1) Empower people to take steps to protect themselves from identity crimes</h3>
          <p>
		 One of the most valuable ways we can help your customers/members/employees is to empower them to protect their identities. The goal is to inspire them to invest in themselves. Accomplish this through timely, easy-to-understand educational content that creates a natural relationship.</p>
          <p><span class="example"><strong>Example</strong><br><br><img width="100%" src="images/AdoptionMarketing/AdoptionMarketing_MeAndMyIdentity1-WM.jpg" alt="Provide a Sense of Control" />
          </span></p>
          
          <hr>
          
          <h3>2) Motivate people to make good security decisions through sound security practices, monitoring tools and reaching out to resolution specialists.</h3>
          <p>
		 By integrating best practices and tools into everyday life, while also taking advantage of expert assistance, we can help people learn to make protective measures a regular part of their lives.</p>
          <p><span class="example"><strong>Example</strong><br><br>
          <img width="100%" src="images/AdoptionMarketing/AdoptionMarketing_LookingOut1-WM.jpg" alt="Provide a Sense of Control" />
          
          </span></p>
          
          <hr>
          
          <h3>3) Encourage a deeper understanding and proactive approach to data protection.</h3>
          <p>
		  If we continue to be better understand identity crimes and proactively protect our information, we will be able to help prevent identity crimes from negatively affecting us.</p>
          <p><span class="example"><strong>Example</strong><br><br>
          <img width="100%" src="images/AdoptionMarketing/AdoptionMarketing_HowThievesSeeYou3-WM.jpg" alt="Provide a Sense of Control" />
          </span></p>
          
          <hr>
                   
          
          <h3>4) Provide a sense of control.</h3>
          <p>
		Protecting your information is easy when you take advantage of the powerful tools, resources and assistance at your fingertips.</p>
          <p><span class="example"><strong>Example 1</strong><br><br>
              		<img width="100%" src="images/AdoptionMarketing/AdoptionMarketing_PalmofYourHand1-WM.jpg" alt="Provide a Sense of Control" /><br><br><strong>Example 2</strong><br><br><img width="100%" src="images/AdoptionMarketing/AdoptionMarketing_Decade1-WM.jpg" alt="Provide a Sense of Control" />
          </span></p>
          
          <hr>
          
          
          <h3>5) Express the critical role people have in protecting themselves from identity crimes.</h3>
          <p>
		 We support taking a proactive role in one’s identity protection; they should be the number one advocate for their good name.</p>
          <p><span class="example"><strong>Example</strong><br><br>
          <img width="100%" src="images/AdoptionMarketing/AdoptionMarketing_Story3-WM.jpg" alt="Provide a Sense of Control" />
          </span></p>
          
          <hr>
          
          
          <h3>6) Emphasize the pervasive nature of sensitive data and the many access points thieves can abuse.</h3>
          <p>
		We live in a connected world, where information security is not always guaranteed. Identity thieves have a number of access points from which they can steal your sensitive information. It’s up to you to understand these risks and manage them appropriately.</p>
          <p><span class="example"><strong>Example 1</strong><br><br>
          <img width="100%" src="images/AdoptionMarketing/AdoptionMarketing_OpenToThieves2-WM.jpg" alt="Provide a Sense of Control" /><br><br><strong>Example 2</strong><br><br>

         <h2 id="voice-and-tone">Messaging We Discourage</h2>
         
      <div class="group">
         
          
          <div class="content"> 
          <h3>Fear-driven marketing messages.</h3>
         
          <p><strong>Reason Why:</strong><br>
The identity protection industry has been inundated with anxiety-inducing marketing. Fear-driven messaging can sometimes lead to deceptive advertising, which ultimately can result in lawsuits against identity protection services. Furthermore, breach fatigue has emerged among consumers and small business owners despite the continued rise in data breaches.</p>
          <p><span class="example"><strong>Example of fear-driven marketing</strong><br><br>
          “If you don’t have identity protection services, you should feel scared.”
          </span></p>

          <p><strong>Alternative Approach:</strong><br>
Empower people to take steps to protect themselves from identity crimes.</p>

          <p><span class="example"><strong>Alternative Example that EZShield approves</strong><br><br>
          “Take charge of your identity and question every request for your personal information.”
          </span></p>
          
          <hr>
          
          
          
          <h3>The phrase “Peace of Mind”</h3>
         
          <p><strong>Reason Why:</strong><br>
“Peace of mind” is such a common phrase across industries that its meaning has become diluted. To differentiate ourselves from our competitors, EZShield encourages moving away from using this phrase. </p>
          <p><span class="example"><strong>Example of "Peace of Mind"</strong><br><br>
          “Enjoy peace of mind from your identity protection service.”
          </span></p>

          <p><strong>Alternative Approach:</strong><br>
Encourage a proactive approach to data protection. We reflect this stance in our tagline Secure Your Identity™.</p>

          <p><span class="example"><strong>Alternative Example that EZShield approves</strong><br><br>
          “Gain the confidence that comes from having comprehensive identity protection on your side.” 
          </span></p>
          
          <hr>
          
          
          <h3>Promoting a false sense of calm.</h3>
         
          <p><strong>Reason Why:</strong><br>
It is misleading to suggest that people with identity protection can ignore potential identity threats. There is no way to fully prevent identity crimes from affecting personal information.</p>
          <p><span class="example"><strong>Example of a false sense of calm</strong><br><br>
          “You have nothing to worry about now that you have identity protection.”  
          </span></p>

          <p><strong>Alternative Approach:</strong><br>
Share relevant news and educational tips to provide helpful guidance for handling personal information.</p>

          <p><span class="example"><strong>Alternative Example that EZShield approves</strong><br><br>
          “Continue taking advantage of the data protection resources available to you.”
          </span></p>
          
          <hr>
          
          
          
          
          <h3>Credit monitoring is the most critical feature of identity protection.</h3>
         
          <p><strong>Reason Why:</strong><br>
Credit monitoring only alerts individuals after they have been victimized. </p>
          <p><span class="example"><strong>Example of a false sense of calm</strong><br><br>
          “If you’ve been affected by a data breach, make sure you get credit monitoring services.”  
          </span></p>

          <p><strong>Alternative Approach:</strong><br>
Explain that credit monitoring is just one of many components that work to protect their identities. Your must address the full spectrum of identity crimes by utilizing a comprehensive suite of protective services.   </p>

          <p><span class="example"><strong>Alternative Example that EZShield approves</strong><br><br>
          Make credit monitoring part of your comprehensive identity protection plan.
          </span></p>

          <h3>Making people feel powerless</h3>
         
          <p><strong>Reason Why:</strong><br>
We recognize the importance of making people feel empowered through positive messages that connect them to their services, which leads to long-term engagement. This is crucial because consumers who feel powerless are often the first to purchase identity protection services. However, they also tend to be the first to leave once the fear of identity theft is no longer top-of-mind. </p>
          <p><span class="example"><strong>Example of making people feel powerless</strong><br><br>
         Without identity protection, there is no way to protect your identity.   
          </span></p>

          <p><strong>Alternative Approach:</strong><br>
Motivate people to make a difference through better security practices, monitoring tools and resolution specialist. </p>

          <p><span class="example"><strong>Alternative Example that EZShield approves</strong><br><br>
         “Knowledge is your first line of defense against identity crimes.”

          <hr>
          
          <h3>Confusing messaging about identity crimes and what identity protection can do.</h3>
          
          <p><strong>Reason Why:</strong><br>
A lack of clarity could misrepresent identity crime risks and identity protection service capabilities, resulting in unsatisfied, distrustful customers that lodge formal complaints.   </p>
          <p><span class="example"><strong>Example</strong> confusing messaging<br><br>
          “Identity protection is the only way to fight identity theft.” (Referring to all crimes or threats as identity theft and then suggesting that identity protection is the answer).    
          </span></p>

          <p><strong>Alternative Approach:</strong><br>
Clearly define the differences between the various types of identity crimes so that people can better understand how they may be impacted. Simultaneously, describe precisely what identity protection services do to help protect against these identity crimes.</p>

          <p><span class="example"><strong>Alternative Example</strong> that EZShield approves<br><br>
          “Be aware of all forms of identity crimes, how to protect yourself and what identity protection services can do for you.”
          </span></p>
          
          <hr>
          <h3>You don’t have to do anything to protect your information; we are doing everything for you. </h3>
          
			  <p><strong>Why We Can't Support This</strong><br>
It’s impossible for that any identity protection service to fully secure a customer’s identity without any involvement from the customer. </p>
          <span class="example"><strong>Example</strong> confusing messaging<br><br>
         Sit back and relax while we take care of all aspects of protecting your identity.
          </span></p>

          <p><strong>Alternative Approach</strong><br>Emphasize that our services hinge on customer activation and engagement through the educational information we provide.   </p>

          <p><span class="example"><strong>Alternative Example</strong> that EZShield approves<br><br>
         Together, you and your identity protection service are an effective team against identity crimes.
          </span></p>
          <hr>
          
          <h3>Identity protection protects you fully, preventing any form of identity crime.  </h3>
          
          <p><strong>Why We Can't Support This</strong><br>
Messages like this give the false impression that identity protection is a magic bullet. Nothing prevents identity crimes 100 percent.  </p>
          <p><span class="example"><strong>Example</strong> confusing messaging<br><br>
         Having identity protection means you are no longer exposed to identity crime threats.
          </span></p>

          <p><strong>Alternative Approach</strong><br>Make it clear that there is no cure-all for identity crimes. </p>

          <p><span class="example"><strong>Alternative Example</strong> that EZShield approves<br><br>
          There is no single answer to identity crimes — it requires a combination of being proactive and having comprehensive identity protection services to back you up.

          	<li><strong>Don’t use identity theft as an all-encompassing term, even if a report/study does.</strong> Identity theft is when a new account is opened in a victim’s name. Payment fraud is when existing accounts are abused.  Lost/stolen PII is when information is unintentionally exposed.
